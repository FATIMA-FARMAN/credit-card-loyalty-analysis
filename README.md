## ðŸ“ˆ Project Overview
This project explores credit-card customer engagement and repayment patterns using a dataset of 8,950 records.  
The analysis builds engineered features (`SPEND_TO_LIMIT`, `PAYMENT_TO_SPEND`, `ADVANCE_RATIO`, `FREQ_SCORE`) to segment customers and uncover key loyalty behaviors.

### Highlights
- Gold segment â†’ â‰ˆ3 Ã— higher average spend than Bronze  
- Silver segment â†’ balanced utilization & repayment ratio  
- 28 % customers â†’ minimum-payment risk flag  
- High spenders â†’ potential upgrade to higher loyalty tier

### Featured Project: Credit Card Loyalty Analysis
[![GitHub Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/View on GitHub-000000?logo=github)](https://github.com/FATIMA-FARMAN/credit-card-loyalty-analysis)

**Goal:** Segment customers and estimate loyalty & LTV indicators from credit card usage data.

## Dataset
`data/Customer_Dataset.csv` (8,950 rows, 18 columns)

## Engineered Features
- `SPEND = PURCHASES + ONEOFF_PURCHASES + INSTALLMENTS_PURCHASES`
- `SPEND_TO_LIMIT = SPEND / CREDIT_LIMIT`
- `PAYMENT_TO_SPEND = PAYMENTS / SPEND`
- `ADVANCE_RATIO = CASH_ADVANCE / SPEND`
- `FREQ_SCORE = PURCHASES_FREQUENCY + ONEOFF_PURCHASES_FREQ + PURCHASES_INSTALLMENTS_FREQUENCY`
- `SEGMENT` via quantiles on `LTV_SCORE_RAW = 0.5*SPEND_TO_LIMIT + 0.3*FREQ_SCORE + 0.2*PRC_FULL_PAYMENT`
